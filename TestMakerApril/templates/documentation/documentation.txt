If you are on some where you see some classes or let say subjects.
you need to understand that first the route will call.e.g 
@index_blueprint.route('/fetchclasses') 
or 
@index_blueprint.route('/fetchsubject')

and then its respective html will call ,e.g fetchclasses.html
or fetchsubject.html

While generating Test
--------------------
A.our approch is to ask user to select the class first.
B.after selecting class user should select subject.

There is a little change in database that every subject has its respective question type

****************************** Change in ERD ***********************************
			subject -----subject_type-----questionType
1 subject has many subjecttype but 1 subjecttype belongs to only 1 subject.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C.after selecting subject we should ask display the question types 

From that question type if user select ESSAYS then all the essay of that subject will be displayed.
